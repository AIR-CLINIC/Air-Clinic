      <h3 class="display-5">BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
      <p>Air-Clinic was founded by a core team of two health-experts and a health-enthusiast who felt the need to effect considerable changes in the way the healthcare sector is handled. The Medical team is lead by Dr. George Edeh & Dr. Blessing Imade while the Project Team is lead by Mr. Ejemai. The ongoing negative trend has been the politicization of healthcare. This puts people’s lives in considerable risks because of selfish interests and ambitions at the helm of affairs. Also there are issues of high cost of healthcare, inequitable distribution, slow hospital processes, long distances to the sources of healthcare etc. These and many other reasons inspires us to decentralize the health sector.</p>
      <p>We started off on a DISCORD COMMUNITY consisting of health-experts, health-workers, and clients. We organize daily health discussions, provide consultation services for clients, provide post-promotion channels and also provide a platform for familiarization between all these different sets of people. However, what we are doing is beyond DISCORD, that’s why we have built a world class website to carter to all the needs we must fill globally. In the nearest future we will have an APP for mobile device users to access us easily.</p>

      <h3 class="display-5">OUR VISION</h2>
      <p>We see a world where a major percentage of all people will be healthy because of the ease of access to healthcare. The good thing is that people will be rewarded for living healthy lives and teaching others how to live healthy too.</p>

      <h3 class="display-5">STRONG POINTS</h2>
      <p>Our service providers are on call 24/7 awaiting your call. Once they receive it, they consult with you and get you the best solutions for the situation.</p>
      <h5>WE ARE QUICK </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Most hospitals (especially the public ones) are known for their snail-like approach to patient care. Long queues, client embarrassment and rushed consultations are the norm.</li>
        <li> We are changing that with quick and straight-to-the-point services. Doctors and other healthcare workers are on call 24/7 to answer your health questions and satisfy your health needs. </li>
        <li> To create a community of health experts, health enthusiasts and clients who can support each other for the sake of healthy living.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE ARE ACCESSIBLE</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You can reach us on this website and also on our DISCORD with just your phone. In due time we will have dedicated APPs just for AIR-CLINIC’s services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE ARE GLOBAL</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Gone are the days when healthcare is limited by location on the map. Our services make it easy for a client in India to consult with a doctor in USA.</li>
        <li> In cases where foreign referrals are needed for further investigations or treatment, it becomes easy when all the facilities and human resources are already inter-linked.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE ARE MAKING PUBLIC HEALTH EASY AGAIN</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical Outreaches, use of mass media, print media, television, radio etc to promote health will be easier because of the internet</li>
        <li>Besides word of mouth will spread the goodnews faster than all those popular media soon.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE ARE AFFORDABLE</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The high costs of healthcare is preventing many persons from accessing healthcare when necessary. Only the rich get optimum care.</li>
        <li> We are combating that by using the STEEM BLOCKCHAIN to subsidize medicare. We also have a healthcare Foundation that will provide free services to the underprivileged in the society.</li>
        <li>We also give rewards to clients who write testimonials and lessons they have learnt and applied during their treatments</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE REMOVE MIDDLEMEN & UNDUE BOTTLENECKS FROM ACCESSING HEALTHCARE</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many cooks they say spoil the brook. There are a lot of middle men sucking resources and slowing down the processes. Politicizing healthcare is also a cog in its wheel</li>
        <li>We are bringing real change with the force of decentralization. Healthcare will now be delivered straight to the clients in a quick and non-stressful manner.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>WE REWARD CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTHCARE & THE MEDICAL FIELD</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Well I guess you have never heard that before but we are doing that. There are too many great men and women who have made medical practice what it is today but many died unnoticed and unappreciated.</li>
        <li>We are going to give incentives to people to live healthy lives and spread optimum healthcare practices.</li>
      </ul>
