            <p style="line-height: 36px">AIR-CLINIC is the first healthcare facility built on the steem blockchain. Our aim is to decentralize healthcare thereby leading to less central control and increased functionality of the medical sector gloablly. The best part of it is that everyone will get rewarded for living healthy lives (or helping others do same). Join us as we detail the <i>"whys" and "hows"</i> below.

            <p>Air-Clinic was founded by a core team of two health-experts and a health-enthusiast who felt the need to effect considerable changes in the way the healthcare sector is handled. The Medical team is lead by Dr. George Edeh & Dr. Blessing Imade while the Business Team is lead by Mr. Ejemai. <br/><br/>We started off on a DISCORD COMMUNITY consisting of health-experts, health-workers, and clients. We organize daily health discussions, provide consultation services for clients, provide post-promotion channels and as well as a platform for familiarization between all of these different sets of people. <br/><br/>However, what we are doing is beyond DISCORD, that’s why we are building a world class web facility and steem frontend to carter to all the needs we must fill globally. In the nearest future we will have an APP for mobile device users to access us easily.</p>

            <h3><img src="https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/icons/svg/671/671666.svg" width="30px" height="30px">Why Decentralize Healthcare?</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 36px">The ongoing negative trend has been the politicization of healthcare. Take the political gaming involved in making & breaking <i>ObamaCare</i> in America as an example. Perhaps politicians don't realize that every action they take (or don't take) directly affect life. Or maybe they do but selfish ambitions always stand in the way of good deeds? We have made them <i>gods</i> that decide who lives and who dies. Is it supposed to be so? 

                    <br/><br/>Also there are issues of high cost of healthcare, inequitable distribution, slow hospital processes, long distances to the sources of healthcare etc. These and many other reasons inspires us to decentralize the health sector. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>With decentralization, everyone understands their role and everyone plays it well. A hospital for example will deliver healthcare to the patients straight without middlemen. The blockchain's openledger helps increase transparency and its <i>trustlessness</i> improves services delivery. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>Using cryptocurrencies to pay for healthcare is the future of medicine. This avails medicine of the opportunities abundant in this <i>digital money era</i>. No we will not miss out in the blockchain technology. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>We are particularly interested in the Steem blockchain. We have seen everything that has been done on it including <i>Utopian, DTube, DSound, DLive, etcz</i>. This is not just another <i>emptily lofty project</i>. No! 
                    
                    <br/><br/>AIR-CLINIC brings professionalism and professionals to the blockchain. Healthcare workers are known to deeply care and give all they have for saving lives. Our team is headed by two of them as well as a health-enthusiast. We all believe that Steem has a <i>love node</i> which we can spread via decentralization. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>The advantages of decentralizing heathcare via the steem blockchain far outweigh the disadvantages if any at all. We are ready for the moon. Let's do this!

                        <br/>->Our service providers are on call 24/7 awaiting your call. Once they receive it, they consult with you and get you the best solutions for the situation.

                <p style="line-height: 30px"> Online services alone will not be enough to allow us to practice a wholistic approach in managing our patients. When we encounter cases that we can’t handle via the online means alone or in cases of emergency, we will have to use the offline method. 

                        <br/><br/>In this scenario, we will be the “medical matchmakers” connecting health service experts and providers to clients who require these services in a speed of light manner. Think of us as the medical version of Uber or AirBnB. 
                        
                        <br/>To allow us achieve this aim of “bringing hospitals to people”, we index health-experts, service providers, healthcare centers, emergency services on our server based on location. This will happen after verification of these services and individuals for quality through our criteria. 
                        
                        <br/>So when we get a got/beep, the available healthcare providers in the nearest location would be contacted to provide the service immediately. The following fields will be indexed. 
                        
                          <br/> -> <b>INDEXING HEALTH EXPERTS-</b> DOCTORS (Specialist and General Practitioner), Nurses, optometrists, physiotherapists, dieticians, pharmacists, medical laboratory scientists,  etc 
                          <br/> -> <b>INDEXING HOSPITALS.</b> Enough of long queues in hospitals because people go to hospitals. We are bringing hospitals to people. We choose the nearest available hospital that can provide a service based on the case at hand. 
                          <br/> -> <b>LABORATORY SERVICES.</b> 
                          <br/> -> <b>INDEXING PHARMACEUTICALS.</b> 
                          <br/> -> <b>INDEXING EMERGENCY SERVICES.</b> There is too much time wasted by emergency services in providing services because of its centralized nature. We will change that by decentralizing that sector so that the nearest ambulance to an emergency will be called.
