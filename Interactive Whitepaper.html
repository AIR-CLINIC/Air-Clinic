            <p style="line-height: 36px">AIR-CLINIC is the first healthcare facility built on the steem blockchain. Our aim is to decentralize healthcare thereby leading to less central control and increased functionality of the medical sector gloablly. The best part of it is that everyone will get rewarded for living healthy lives (or helping others do same). Join us as we detail the <i>hows and whys</i> below.

            <p>Air-Clinic was founded by a core team of two health-experts and a health-enthusiast who felt the need to effect considerable changes in the way the healthcare sector is handled. The Medical team is lead by Dr. George Edeh & Dr. Blessing Imade while the Project Team is lead by Mr. Ejemai. <br/><br/>We started off on a DISCORD COMMUNITY consisting of health-experts, health-workers, and clients. We organize daily health discussions, provide consultation services for clients, provide post-promotion channels and also provide a platform for familiarization between all of these different sets of people. <br/><br/>However, what we are doing is beyond DISCORD, that’s why we are building a world class steemified frontend website to carter to all the needs we must fill globally. In the nearest future we will have an APP for mobile device users to access us easily.</p>

            <h3><img src="https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/icons/svg/671/671666.svg" width="30px" height="30px">Why Decentralize Healthcare?</h3>
            <p style="line-height: 36px">The ongoing negative trend has been the politicization of healthcare. Take the political gaming involved in making & breaking <i>ObamaCare</i> in America as an example. Perhaps politicians don't realize that every action they take (or don't take) directly affect life. Or maybe they do but selfish ambitions always stand in the way of good deeds? We have made them <i>gods</i> that decide who lives and who dies. Is it supposed to be so? 

                    <br/><br/>Also there are issues of high cost of healthcare, inequitable distribution, slow hospital processes, long distances to the sources of healthcare etc. These and many other reasons inspires us to decentralize the health sector. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>With decentralization, everyone understands their role and everyone plays it well. A hospital for example will deliver healthcare to the patients straight without middlemen. The blockchain's openledger helps increase transparency and its <i>trustlessness</i> improves services delivery. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>Using cryptocurrencies to pay for healthcare is the future of medicine. This avails medicine of the opportunities abundant in this <i>digital money era</i>. No we will not miss out in the blockchain technology. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>We are particularly interested in the Steem blockchain. We have seen everything that has been done on it including <i>Utopian, DTube, DSound, DLive, etcz</i>. This is not just another <i>emptily lofty project</i>. No! 
                    
                    <br/><br/>AIR-CLINIC brings professionalism and professionals to the blockchain. Healthcare workers are known to deeply care and give all they have for saving lives. Our team is headed by two of them as well as a health-enthusiast. We all believe that Steem has a <i>love node</i> which we can spread via decentralization. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>The advantages of decentralizing heathcare via the steem blockchain far outweigh the disadvantages if any at all. We are ready for the moon. Let's do this!

            <p style="line-height: 30px">-> Most hospitals (especially the public ones) are known for their snail-like approach to patient care. Long queues, client embarrassment and rushed consultations are the norm.

                <p style="line-height: 30px">->The high costs of healthcare is preventing many persons from accessing healthcare when necessary. Only the rich get optimum care. 
                       <br/> -> We are combating that by using the STEEM BLOCKCHAIN to subsidize medicare. We also have a healthcare Foundation that will provide free services to the underprivileged in the society.
