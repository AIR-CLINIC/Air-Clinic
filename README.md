## Short Summary:
After reviewing the previous website, we felt the need to use a friendly interface with interactive UI for the project. This will ensure easier onboarding of users and make the task of explaining ourself less tasking.

## Description:
The website is divided into segments which will make it easier to naviagate. Also we kept to our brand's color theme's so that users can experience a certain effect while using the web facility.

#### Here Are The Subdivisions:
- **Home:** contains the navigational elements with background image, brand logo and catchy description.
- **About:** contains the descriptive information about the project divided into 3 main subsections.
- **Services:** contains the summary of what users can expect to get from using the web interface.
- **Team:** contains a short bio of the core team members and a link to their steemit profile.
- **Blog:** opens on a new page. Contains the blog elements transmitting our posts from the steem blockchain (@air-clinic).
- **Contact:** contains hypertext and CSS-styled links to our github, steemit, discord and whitepaper. In the future this should include our email and phone number contact.
*Also note that there are other minor sections like **Trusted By** and the **Start Now** links.

**Below is a preview:**

We believe that users will enjoy this interface. Its our baby step towards a decentralized medical world using the blockchain. We are already finalizing work on our Web dAPP which will be used by everyone soon.

*Thank You!*
