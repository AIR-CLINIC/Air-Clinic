## Short Summary:
After reviewing the previous website, we felt the need to use a more friendly web platform with interactive UI for the project. This will ensure easier onboarding of users and make the task of explaining ourself less difficult. 

Also its our sincere hope that users will take ownership of the platform and use it for what its for, healthcare. This informed our choice of new domain name - [https://myAirClinic.com](https://myairclinic.com). It should be easier to remember and unmistakable.

## Description:
The website is divided into segments which will make it easier to naviagate. Also we kept to our brand's color theme's so that users can experience a certain effect while using the web facility.

#### Here Are The Subdivisions:
- **Home:** contains the navigational elements with background image, brand logo and catchy description.
- **About:** contains the descriptive information about the project divided into 3 main subsections.
- **Services:** contains the summary of what users can expect to get from using the web interface.
- **Team:** contains a short bio of the core team members and a link to their steemit profile.
- **Blog:** opens on a new page. Contains the blog elements transmitting our posts from the steem blockchain (@air-clinic).
- **Contact:** contains hypertext and CSS-styled links to our github, steemit, discord and whitepaper. In the future this should include our email and phone number contact.
*Also note that there are other minor sections like **Trusted By** and the **Start Now** links.
