      <p>This is the crux of our services. We have built a world class website where you can consult healthcare experts of different specialties globally for any type of ailment. Our service providers are on call 24/7 awaiting your call. Once they receive it, they consult with you and get you the best solutions for the situation.</p>
      <i>Commonly used resources include;</i>
      <ul>
        <li>Text Chat, Voice Chat, Video Chat, Graphs and Charts</li>
        <li> Referral system: It will be easy for a medical practitioner to refer a client to another expert who either has more experience or is more specialized in a particular field.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="row py-4">
      <h3 class="display-5">OFFLINE MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS</h2>
      <p>Online services alone will not be enough to allow us to give that holistic approach in managing our patients. When we encounter cases that we can’t handle via the online means alone or in cases of emergency, we will have to use the offline method.

          In this scenario, we will be the “medical matchmakers” connecting health service experts and providers to clients who require these services in a speed of light manner. Think of us as the medical version of Uber or AirBnB.
          
          To allow us achieve this aim of “bringing hospitals to people”, we index health-experts, service providers, healthcare centers, emergency services on our server based on location. This will happen after verification of these services and individuals for quality through our criteria.</p>
      <i>So when we get a got/beep, the available healthcare providers in the nearest location would be contacted to provide the service immediately. The following fields will be indexed. ;</i>
      <ul>
        <li>INDEXING HEALTH EXPERTS- DOCTORS (Specialist and General Practitioner), Nurses, optometrists, physiotherapists, dieticians, pharmacists, medical laboratory scientists, etc</li>
        <li>INDEXING HOSPITALS. Enough of long queues in hospitals because people go to hospitals. We are bringing hospitals to people. We choose the nearest available hospital that can provide a service based on the case at hand.</li>
        <li>INDEXING LABORATORY SERVICES.</li>
        <li>INDEXING PHARMACEUTICALS.</li>
        <li>INDEXING EMERGENCY SERVICES. There is too much time wasted by emergency services in providing services because of its centralized nature. We will change that by decentralizing that sector so that the nearest ambulance to an emergency will be called.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>There’s no well organized body that curates medical research, health-related journals and achievements. This is where we come in…</li>
        <li>We would reward health-experts, enthusiasts and clients who have contributed to the improvement of medical care in the following ways:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Articles, Essays, Researches etc</li>
          <li>Client Testimonials and lessons after consultation</li>
          <li>There’s no well organized body that curates medical research, health-related journals and achievements. This is where we come in…</li>
          <li>Outstanding public service in known medical bodies</li>
          <li>Medical science discoveries of medicines, new techniques, new surgeries, new knowledge, new observations etc</li>

      <h3 class="display-5">LABORATORY SERVICES IN ASSOCIATION WITH MAJOR LABORATORIES GLOBALLY</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We link up our clients with the appropriate medical laboratory that will provide the investigations needed for further diagnosis and expert management of the case.</li>
        <li>Like was mentioned earlier, we index Medical Laboratories and Medical Laboratory scientists, radiographers, pathologists, radiologists etcz.</li>

      <h3 class="display-5">SUPPLY OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES IN ASSOCIATION WITH MAJOR PHARMACEUTICALS GLOBALLY:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We use our doctor’s prescription to find out the appropriate drugs. But we don’t just allow the client to go source it by him/herself. This is where many people go wrong because they could get the wrong prescriptions over-the-counter. Sometimes medications are even expired and the client doesn’t know.</li>
        <li>We link up with standard pharmaceuticals worldwide to provide the needed medicines at affordable rates better than they could have been gotten outside our services and quality is guaranteed.</li>
        <li>Our indexed pharmacists, pharmaceutical technicians and pharmaceutical companies will come in handy here.</li>

      <h3 class="display-5">STORAGE & RETRIEVAL OF MEDICAL RECORDS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN
        </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First of all, this doesn’t exist anywhere else right now! We want to change that. There are many problems with the traditional system of keeping patient case notes in hospitals only. The client will not be able to access his/her own records easily. Sometimes these documents are lost forever and many years of consulting healthcare becomes in vain.</li>
        <li>Besides when a person needs to be referred, their records will need to be photocopied first and sent to the new doctor managing the case. All those long processes become easy if there is a decentralized platform for storing these files.</li>
        <li>It means Dr. A in Nigeria will see what Dr. B in UK has prescribed for a given client. The clients too can equally retrieve his/her notes for future references.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Despite all these many services, we know some under-privileged ones who do not have access to quality healthcare or the internet could still miss it.</li>
        <li>On that note, we will organize rural outreaches on a global scale to reach out to them and provide solutions.</li>
        <li>We source for funds via donations from willing individuals who want their money to work for them.</li>
